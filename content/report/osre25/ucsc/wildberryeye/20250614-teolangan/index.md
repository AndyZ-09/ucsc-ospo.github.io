Hello! My name is [Teodor Langan](/content/authors/teolangan), an undergraduate student currently persueing a Robotics Engineering degree at the University of California, Santa Cruz. This Summer, I'll be working on developing the hardware for the [WildBerryEye](/project/osre25/ucsc/wildberryeye/) project, mentored by [Carlos Isaac Espinosa](/content/authors/caiespin). Here is my [project proposal](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1DfZLWl3ccZk3ss9yMP6oL9dpsyypRBDA/view?usp=sharing)!

My project focuses on tackling the hardware challenge for WildBerryEye, an open-source ecological monitoring platform built on Raspberry Pi. To reliably support the real-time object detection provided by the system, it requires a robust and weather-resistant camera enclosure that can reliably protect its electronics in the field. To address this, I will be designing and prototyping a modular, 3D-printable camera case using FreeCAD this Summer. The case will be able to protect electrical components from rain and dust while incorporating proper ventilation and heat dissipation features. Designed using FreeCAD, the entire model will be fully open-source, allowing for easy adoption and modification by the community. Over this Summer, this work will incorporate multiple rounds of field testing to test and refine the design under accurate field conditions. Ultimately, my project aims to deliver a detailed open-source FreeCAD model, full assembly documentation, and a user guide. 

I'm excited to see what we can learn througout the development of my project!
