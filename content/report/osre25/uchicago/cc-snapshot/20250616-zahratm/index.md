Hello, My name is Zahra Temori. I am a rising senior in Computer Science at University of Delaware. I’m excited to be working with the Summer of Reproduciblity  and the Chameleon Cloud community. My project is [cc-snapshot](https://github.com/ChameleonCloud/cc-snapshot) that focuses on enhancing features for helping researchers capture and share reproducible experimental environments within the Chameleon Cloud testbed. 

Here is a detailed information about my project and plans to work for summer [proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1kFOFL-H4WrXF7EUuXzcHLZ2p5w_DxbbWOGi-IGx39LM/edit?tab=t.0).

### June 10 – June 14, 2025

Getting started with the first milestone and beginning to explore the Chameleon Cloud and the project:

- I began familiarizing myself with the Chameleon Cloud platform. I created an account and successfully accessed a project.
- I learned how to launch an instance and create a lease for using computing resources.
- I met with my mentor to discuss the project goals and outline the next steps.
- I experimented with the environment and captured a snapshot to understand the process.

It has been less than a week and I have learned a lot specially about the Chameleon Cloud and how it is different from other clouds like AWS. I am exited to learn more and make progress.

Thanks for reading, I will keep ypu updated as I work :)
