Devansh Kukreja is an undergraduate student at the Jaypee Institute of Information Technology, India. His interests lie in building distributed systems, real-time data pipelines, and tools that bridge the gap between software and the physical world. He’s passionate about open source, and currently contributes to projects that focus on environmental sensing and scalable data infrastructure.

As part of GSoC 2025, he is working on enhancing the ENTS platform—an open-source web portal for large-scale environmental sensor networks—under the mentorship of Colleen Josephson, John Madden, and Alec Levy. He’s especially excited about improving system reliability and building intuitive interfaces that help researchers gather and analyze data more effectively.
